Selected solutions to some Advent of Code 2018 problems (https://adventofcode.com/2018)

All solutions are written in Haskell, using open-source libraries when applicable. A small local library is also included for convenience. I have also included my inputs so that you can run the code on actual data without potentially spoiling your own solutions.
